    #
    # Why three --where arguments?
    #
    # The first --where sets the working directory to the egg root directory.
    # This helps normalize any file operations, e.g. loading of config files.
    #
    # Subsequent --where arguments add directories to the list of directories that
    # will be recursively scanned by nose for tests to run. This has two effects:
    #
    # 1. Tests are discovered and run. Hence, we supply the test directory
    #    (either unit tests or integration tests) as our third --where argument,
    #    so that we actually find the appropriate tests to run!
    #
    # 2. When packages and modules are scanned by nose, this also makes them known
    #    to the coverage module, so it can report on whether the modules were covered
    #    by the tests.
    #
    #    Without the --where=PACKAGE_DIR argument, the coverage module would only
    #    be aware of modules that are explicitly imported by tests.
    #
    #    Of course, we want coverage to tell us if there are modules that we *didn't*
    #    import in the tests! So, we include the PACKAGE_DIR in the list of directories
    #    for nose to scan.
    #
    # The fact that nose scans the package directory for tests has two undesirable
    # effects, however:
    #
    # 1. Any methods that *look* like test methods to nose will be run as tests.
    #    As a result, you need to be careful to avoid methods that begin with the name test_.
    #
    # 2. If you have any module-level code that runs on import (for example, Celery worker
    #    initialization), that code will run when nose scans and imports the package.
    #
    #    This might be a problem if that module-level code has side effects, or depends on
    #    preconditions like environment variables or config files.
    #
    #    To work around this, you can mark executable (chmod +x) any modules that perform such
    #    initialization. Be aware that if you do this, the module will no longer be included
    #    in nose's coverage report unless explicitly imported by a test, so do so gingerly.
